				<summary>VLOGES ABOUT BLOCHISTAN</summary>
					<p>
						Balochistan takes its names from the Baloch who inhabit it, 
						a mostly Sunni Muslim people who speak an Iranian language, 
						Balochi, that is oddly classified neither as an eastern Iranian 
						language like Pashto to its north or a southwestern Iranian language
						like Persian to its west. Rather, Balochi is a northwestern Iranian 
						language, most closely related to Kurdish. It is thus a matter of 
						some conjecture as to when and how the Baloch actually got to Balochistan.
